        summary: >
            Undergraduate Researchers in the Caporaso Lab develop and support
            QIIME 2, a leading microbiome bioinformatics platform.


            Typically students will:

              * contribute to the [QIIME 2 ecosystem](https://github.com/qiime2) (Python)
              * [design and build interactive data visualizations](https://view.qiime2.org) (JavaScript, various frameworks)
              * [develop bioinformatics plugins](https://library.qiime2.org) (Various languages)
              * [create and manage product documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org) (Jinja2, Sphinx)
              * [provide user support](https://forum.qiime2.org) (Discourse)
              * explore DevOps and build pipelines (GitHub Actions)

        summary: >
            As members of the Center for Applied Microbiome Science, undergraduates
            perform bioinformatics analysis on contemporary studies. These
            contributions yield published work, experience with research design,
            and valuable collaborative relationships.

      - name: Publications & Research Travel
        summary: >
            In addition to a strong portfolio of GitHub contributions, undergraduate
            researchers are supported in developing conference posters, presentations,
            collaborative, and independent research publications. Contributions to lab
            publications are often welcome, and students co-author publications that they
            contribute to.


            Fully-funded opportunities to travel in support of research products
            are also frequent. Caporaso Lab students have presented at:

              - Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference
              - 3rd Workshop on Statistical and Algorithmic Challenges in Microbiome Data Analysis ([SACMDA](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/3rd-workshop-on-statistical-and-algorithmic-challenges-in-microbiome-data-analysis/)) in New York, NY
              - The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis ([SC18](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/)) in Dallas, TX
              - QIIME 2 workshops in Phoenix and Las Vegas

      - name: Flexible Work Schedule
        summary: >
            Undergraduates balance diverse responsibilities, and academic
            performance is top priority. Students are asked to work 10-20 hours
            per week while school is in session, and may work up to 40 hours during
            breaks (subject to Northern Arizona University employment policies).
            Flexible scheduling accommodates coursework and exam requirements.
